Further evaluations on data will be made in the\r\nsummary.\r\n***Money not awarded in agreement but ENLC completed work\r\nfor BLM utilizing funds from noxious weeds.,"Methods\r\nBLM ESR personnel stratified and selected eight (8-10) 2,827.4 sq. meter-monitoring sites within\r\nthe aerial and drill seeding treatments and the aerial herbicide treatment areas. Monitoring plots\r\nwere stratified within dominant Map Unit Dominant Ecological Sites and by the ES and BAR\r\ntreatments. Points were created randomly within those two strata in ArcGIS utilizing the \u201cCreate\r\nRandom Points Tool.\u201d Plot rejection criteria followed AIM monitoring standards including\r\nrejection of plots over 50% slope and greater than three miles from a road. Monitoring plots were\r\nestablished, surveyed, and recorded in the summer of 2018 by an assistance agreement with\r\nEastern Nevada Landscape Coalition. Monitoring data recorded included vegetation density and\r\ncover using photo points, quadrat density counts, line-point intercept (LPI), canopy gap of all\r\nperennial plant species and annual grasses, and plot observation and characterization including\r\nerosional assessments. Monitoring methods were followed as described in: Monitoring Manual\r\nfor Grassland, Shrubland and Savanna Ecosystems, Volume 1: Core Methods, Second Edition,\r\nHerrick et al, 2017. Paced quadrat density count methods were developed in 2014 by BLM staff\r\nand advised by Sampling Vegetation Attributes \u2013 Interagency Technical Reference 1734-4, 1996\r\n(p. 25-26, 94-101).\r\n\r\n2022 ESR Monitoring Results\r\nS2 Drill Seeding/S3 Aerial Mid-Elevation \r\nDry Gulch AIM Plot 01A is located in a Rangeland Loamy 10-12\u201d P.Z.

R025XY021NV site in a former / / Artemisia tridentate ssp. wyomingensis / Pseudoroegneria spicata - Achnatherum thurberianum (/ Wyoming big sagebrush / bluebunch wheatgrass - Thurber's needlegrass) vegetation community. \r\nThe Bitterbrush Drill Treatment seed mix was applied via rangeland drill to the public burned land in accordance with the ecological sites and elevation and was comprised of Antelope Bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), Bluebunch Wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Small Burnet (Sanguisorba minor), Blue Flax (Linum perenne), Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), and Russian Wildrye (Psathyrostachys juncea). \r\nThe Aerial Mid Elevation Treatment seed mix was applied via fixed wing aircraft to the public burned land in accordance with the ecological sites and elevation and was comprised of Wyoming Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata sbsp wyomingensis), Basin Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata sbsp tridentata), and Western Yarrow (Achillea millefolium var occidentalis).\r\nDensity Results \r\nRehabilitation objectives are considered successfully met when one native forb per square meter, 0.3 native shrubs per square meter, and three grasses per square meter are established. \r\n2018: The rehabilitation objectives in the first growing season have not been fully met, though there has been shown progress towards success, especially for the seeded grasses. Seeded grasses nearly reached density objectives as there were 2.63 seeded grasses per square meter in the first growing season. The grasses have not developed deep roots, however and the area needs to be rested until the plants achieve more robust basal and canopy growth. Seeded forbs have achieved an average density of 0.13 per square meter. Seeded antelope bitterbrush shrubs were not found in first year monitoring. The insufficient snowpack and drought-like summer conditions may have contributed to the inability of the shrubs to establish in the area. \r\n2019: No seeded species were observed. Notably, seeded bitterbrush were also not observed this year. However, native recovery of large-form grasses (squirreltail and Thurber\u2019s needlegrass) and small-form grasses (Sandberg bluegrass and thickspike wheatgrass) was still evident. This is unexpected given the improved weather conditions over the past year. \r\n2020: Seeded grasses were observed. Bluebunch wheatgrass was the primary observed seeded grass. There were no other seeded species observed through density. \r\n2022: The rehabilitation objectives for this treatment have been met. Native regrowth of perennial grasses has been very successful at a combined total of 34.8/m2, perennial forbs at 8.8/m2, and shrubs at 1.3/m2. Seeded species have not been as successful as the native regrowth but shrubs and grasses are present and given more time have a chance of continuing progress towards greater rehabilitation of the plots.\r\nAIM Data Results \r\nCover \r\n2018: Foliar cover eclipsed the bare ground in the first growing season, mostly due to the 22% invasive annual desert madwort cover, 23% cheatgrass cover, 20% Sandberg\u2019s bluegrass cover. Perennial forbs have not produced significant cover yet (1.9%). Seeded species haven\u2019t produced significant cover either, as is expected in an area with so much annual, invasive plant competition. \r\n2019: Perennial grasses dominated foliar cover (39.7%), primarily due to the presence of Sandberg\u2019s bluegrass (28.3%). Second and third highest cover were cheatgrass (24.0%) and desert madwort (18.0%). The dominant cover change is an improvement from 2018. Seeded species did not contribute to cover. \r\n2020: Perennial grasses continued to dominate foliar cover, primarily due to the presence of Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and thickspike wheatgrass. Cheatgrass levels are still approximately the same while desert madwort cover has reduced since 2019 observations. Perennial species collectively have more cover than annual species. \r\n2022: Total foliar cover was moderately high at 72.3% with perennial grasses dominating at 31.3%, followed by annual forbs (11.1%) and annual grasses (10.2%). Annual forbs were the only indicator that had an increase in foliar cover from 2020 and it was very minimal. All other indicators had a decrease in cover, the most substantial being annual grasses, down by 10.8% since 2020. Overall, perennial species still constitute more of the cover than annuals though they have gotten closer to being equal since 2020.\r\nGaps and Erosion \r\n2018: Gaps in canopy cover were significant and the largest number were greater than 200 centimeters long, the largest measured threshold category. Canopy gaps of this size and frequency have allowed wind and water erosion to occur on the plots, degrading the hydrologic function and soil and site stability. Over 50% of the surface area consists of gaps greater than 25 centimeters. Wind and water erosion were affecting the soil and site stability on both plots: there was rarely occurring deposition and run-off. Commonly occurring pedestals with rarely exposed roots were also present. \r\n2019: Canopy gaps were mostly between 25 and 50cm long and represented 26.7% of the average 25m transects. Canopy gaps have decreased on the plots since 2018 observations. Similar rare deposition/runoff observations were made along with reduced pedestalling and increased water flow patterns. Reduced observations of pedestals, deposition/runoff, and water flow patterns were made, indicating more stability on the site. \r\n2020: Canopy gaps were mostly between 51 and 100 cm long, and only by a small amount greater than the 25 to 50 cm long category. Gaps now represent 22.8% of the average 25m transects, which is a decrease from 2019 observations. No pedestalling was observed, along with rare deposition/runoff and water flow patterns, indicating increased soil stability on the site. \r\n2022: Canopy gaps were predominately between 51-100cm (17.5%), closely followed by 25-50cm (14.7%), and gaps >200cm were observed again (3.7%) after not being observed in 2020. The majority of the gaps being in the smaller size ranges is better for the overall plot health and the 3.7% >200cm consisted of two gaps meeting that criteria across both plots. No observations of site and soil instability was observed on either plot, indicating improvement of soil and site stability across the plots.\r\nSpecies Richness\r\n2022: Species richness was moderately high with 28 individual species identified on average between the two plots. Perennial forbs and grasses outnumbered their annual counterparts and with four shrub species in addition to the perennials the diversity of species on the plots indicate the possibility of continued improvement on the site.\r\nRecommendations \r\n2018: Monitoring results in the treatment area have shown that rehabilitation objectives have not been fully met in the first growing season. Although the area had a successful number of bluebunch wheatgrass seedlings establish, those plants need an additional two growing seasons in order to develop the beneficial and stabilizing root masses. The area needs to remain closed so seeded forb and shrub species may establish, especially the antelope bitterbrush which is at risk in the area of not recovering and providing valuable forage to wildlife. If the area receives sufficient snowpack and spring and summer precipitation, seeded species will continue to establish. \r\n2019: Monitoring results in the treatment area have shown that rehabilitation objectives have not been fully met in the second growing season. Fewer seeded species observations were made this year. This is unexpected given the improved weather conditions over the past year. There was an allotment closure issued for the Gamble Individual allotment, Granite Creek pasture where Plots 01A and 01B are located. The allotment closure objective of three perennial species per square meter was met but it is advised that the area receives appropriate rest so that seeded forb and shrub species may establish, especially the antelope bitterbrush which is at risk in the area of not recovering and providing valuable forage to wildlife. \r\n2020: Monitoring results in the treatment area have shown that rehabilitation objectives have not been fully met in the third growing season. More seeded grass observations were made this year. There was an allotment closure issued for the Gamble Individual allotment, Granite Creek pasture where Plots 01A and 01B are located. The allotment closure objective of three perennial species per square meter was met but it is advised that the area receives appropriate grazing management so that seeded forb and shrub species may establish. \r\n2022: The rehabilitation objectives for these plots have been met. The native regrowth on the plots were significant enough to meet the objectives while the seeded species continued to show improvement towards the rehabilitation of the site. There was an allotment closure issued for the Gamble Individual allotment, Granite Creek pasture where Plots 01A and 01B are located. The allotment closure objective of three perennial species per square meter was met and it is advised that the area continues to receive appropriate grazing management so that seeded forb and shrub species may continue to establish.",See Word doc,Point,Confirmed,Digitized by LTDL data entry personnel using a confirmed map,,0,0,,See Cooperators List,"Erosion, Establishment of seeded species, Habitat productivity, Habitat quality, Invasion by non-native annuals, Invasive species, Livestock in treated area, Noxious weeds, Vegetal cover",To determine the effectiveness of ES & BAR plan treatments to meet planned\r\nobjectives.,,,,,2018 - ***Money not awarded in agreement but ENLC completed work for BLM utilizing funds from noxious weeds.,39:01.0
